# CS-350-module-eight
Module Eight Journal Assignment

## This code was written for TI LaunchPad
## Part No: CC2330SF-LAUNCH-XL
Code is solely written within gpiointerrupt.c

## Summarize the project
This is a thermostat. There is no way for the TI board to heat the environment, so this is only the logic. A desired temperature is set in the code. It can be increased by pressing a button. The board has a termperature sensor. A red light turns off and on based on whether the theoretical heater is "on."

## What did you do particularly well?
I implemented state machines and a task scheduler with efficacy.

## Where could you improve?
I could improve the project by researching other methods that don't require so many global variables (though I'm not sure this would be possible). Also there are a lot of comments in the code that can be removed.

## What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
The ZyBook chapter was extremely helpful. I'll use it as long as I can for future projects.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Analyzing the problem and breaking it down into smaller parts. This is the only reason I was successful. I sketched out the state machines, edited them, scrapped them, until the logic made sense and was easily translated into code.

## How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
There are many helpful comments that explain what is happening and what is the overall purpose/goal of the project.
